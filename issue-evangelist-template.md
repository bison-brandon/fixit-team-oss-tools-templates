Hi maintainers! I recently posted this security patch (PR)[$LINK_TO_PR]. 

The two tools we used to identify the vulnerabilities there were [Salus](https://github.com/coinbase/salus) and the [OSSF scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard). 

Any interest in adding these to the $TOOL repository? I am happy to help with the integration.
