Hi maintainers! I'm $NAME and I work at [Bison Trails](https://bisontrails.co/). We're doing an internal hackathon this week.

Our team loves $TOOL, but it got flagged during a recent security review. Our team voted to use our hackathon time to patch vulnerabilities in our favorite OSS tools and specifically to try to get $TOOL approved for usage within our organization. 

## What's here:
- bulleted
- description
- of 
- changes

## Impact: 
These changes should improve $TOOL's security posture. We identified these vulnerabilities using [Salus](https://github.com/coinbase/salus) and the [OSSF scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard). The specific issues I am hoping to address here are:
- bulleted
- description
- of
- vulnerabilities
- addressed

## What's next:
*(describe follow-up PRs as applicable.)*


Thank you so much for your work maintaining $TOOL, and thank you for taking the time to look at these proposed changes!
